# 📝 Task Manager CLI App

A simple and interactive Command-Line Task Manager built using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Easily add, view, and complete both normal and priority tasks.

## 🚀 Features

- Add normal tasks
- Add priority tasks (High, Medium, Low)
- View all tasks with completion status
- Mark tasks as completed
- Object-Oriented structure using:
  - Abstraction (`Task` abstract base class)
  - Inheritance (`NormalTask`, `PriorityTask`)
  - Encapsulation (private data in each task)
  - Polymorphism (common `display()` interface)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- OOP Principles
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
